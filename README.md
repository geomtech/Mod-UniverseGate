# UniverseGate

UniverseGate is a portal-focused mod for Fabric that lets you build and link **gateways** between locations (and dimensions), then brave a mysterious dimension called **the Rift**.

## Main Features

- **Buildable portal gates**: assemble a Portal Core + Portal Frame to form a functional gateway.
- **Portal network & naming**: each gate can be named and selected from an in-game list.
- **Portal Keyboard & fuel**: use the Portal Keyboard UI to open connections; powered by **Rift Ash**.
- **The Rift dimension**: a strange void-like world with its own atmosphere, resources, and dangers.
- **Lightning-powered Rift breaches**: charge a special lightning rod and force an unstable Rift link.
- **New content**: blocks, items, ambient sounds, and the hostile **Rift Shade**.

## How To Use

1. **Build a gate**
   - The frame interior is **3x4** (outer size **5x6**).
   - Place the **Portal Core** at the **bottom center** of the frame.
2. **Place a Portal Keyboard nearby**
   - The keyboard must be placed close to the gate.
3. **Fuel it with Rift Ash**
   - Insert **Rift Ash** into the keyboard.
4. **Open a connection**
   - Use the keyboard to pick a destination gate and open the portal.

Notes:
- Portals automatically close after a short duration.
- Traveling through non-Rift destinations consumes fuel; if fuel runs out, the portal shuts down.

## The Rift (What To Expect)

- Entering the Rift can trigger an **unstable collapse** shortly after arrival.
- Explore to find strange structures and supplies, and watch out for **Rift Shades**.
- **Kelo** wood and Rift-related materials support progression and fueling.

## Opening A Rift Breach

UniverseGate includes a **Charged Lightning Rod** that can store lightning charge and use it to open an **unstable** portal link to the Rift (when placed near a completed gate).

## Blocks & Items Included

- Portal blocks: **Portal Core**, **Portal Frame**, **Portal Keyboard**, **Portal Field**
- Rift materials: **Void Block**, **Light Block**, **Kelo Log/Planks**, **Rift Ash**
